## ps3

In this problem set we must build a words with friends analogue using the pre-supplied code as a base.

This is the 3rd problem set from the 2016 MIT 6.00/6.001 course available at:

https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/

The unedited code will be available with unedited prefix. My attempt is ps3.py

The pdf file explains the problem scope, read this carefully to understand the problem set.
